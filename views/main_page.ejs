      <h2 class="wrap-text">What is Yoga Psychotherapy?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Yoga Psychotherapy</strong> is a combination of two words — <em>“Yoga”</em> from Sanskrit and <em>“Psychotherapy”</em> from Greek. It is a holistic approach for developing physical, mental, social, and spiritual health. It supports individuals suffering from:
        mood swings, sadness, low self-esteem, anger, fear, anxiety, depression, and various psychological issues.
      </p>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>YOGA PSYCHOTHERAPY</strong> is a goal-oriented, structured, time-bounded talk therapy for solving present problems and transforming dysfunctional thoughts and behaviours into functional ones through self-awareness and yogic consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is rooted in ancient Yoga philosophy and modern psychology. It helps modify harmful thoughts and unproductive behaviours into positive, goal-oriented, and productive actions—ultimately leading to self-actualization, self-realization, and a peaceful, purposeful life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Sharma established the first <strong>Yoga Psychotherapy Center</strong> in Bhuj.
      </p>

      <p>
        A scientific abstract titled <strong>“Yoga Psychotherapy for Mental Illness”</strong> was presented at the <strong>20th World Congress of Psychiatry</strong> organized by the World Psychiatric Association in Bangkok.
      </p>

        A brief introduction to Yoga Psychotherapy is available in the linked PDF below.
